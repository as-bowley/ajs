# AJS Auto Electrical

## Description

This project is a website for an auto electrical company based in the UK. It's my first time using both Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Although the website is simple, it was a perfect oppurtunity to gain familiary with these new-to-me technologies. There were no real difficulties creating this website, largely because it's just a static site, but I really enjoyed using Tailwind and will endeavour to use it on my personal projects going forward. Next.js was also wonderfully easy to use and really made the whole process simple. I opted to use Next.js 13 with the experimental app directory and had no issues with it.
